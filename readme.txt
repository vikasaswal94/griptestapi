Grip Invest Coding Assignment 2021



Hi, and thanks for expressing interest in Grip. Below, you’ll find a high-level problem description.
 We’d like you to implement a full-stack solution to this problem. You are free to use resources
  like the internet and books to help you. However, we do expect the solution to be your own work.
   The description below is not highly specific. We’d like you to make thoughtful assumptions in areas.
    Where requirements are unclear, be prepared to talk to us about your decisions.

When you feel good about your solution, check your code into Github and share it with investgrip

Problem description:

Grip is an investment platform and has various assets that we offer to our clients to invest in.
 We do have an in-house CRM called ‘Terminal’ which we use to track various entities (e.g. clients,
  assets, orders, etc). With the increase in volume of transactions on our platform over the past 
  few months, it has gotten difficult to search these entities on the terminal. We want to create a 
  search on the frontend that would be a typeahead to search these.

The aim of the project is to create a UI component in React that searches for these entities and 
displays them in a dropdown which converts into a chip when selected. The options in the dropdown are 
to be fetched in real time from the database via express API. Allowing to add multiple entities is a 
bonus but not a requirement.


Frequently asked questions

What do you mean by full-stack?
Your solution should include data storage (preferably Mysql), API’s or a middle tier 
(preferably written in Javascript), and a web-based front end, in ReactJS. Your goal should be to 
build enough to demonstrate the depth and breadth of your software development skills. 
It needs to be a full stack solution that aptly demonstrates your experience in both 
frontend and backend technologies.

We recognize that most developers gravitate towards different parts of the stack. 
In fact, we’d expect you to make better decisions in the areas with you having greater expertise, 
and demonstrate an ability to quickly learn areas where you have little or no expertise.

How long should this take?
How much effort you put into it is up to you, but we’d like to see your solution in a week 
(quicker, the better). We recognize that you likely have a ton of other commitments in your life. 
Put enough effort in this project so that 1) we can view you in your best light and 2) 
you can understand if you like working on an ambiguous, full-stack problem. 
The problem described above is very small, but you could easily add functionality as 
you see fit to improve on the requirements.

What are you looking for?
We assume that you can create a functionally correct solution. Beyond that, 
we strongly prefer quality over quantity, simplicity over complexity, and readability over cleverness.
